# Open Unified TTS - Demo Script

## Concept
A 60-90 second audio demo that showcases:
1. Multiple voice clones working together
2. Seamless long-form generation (the chunking magic)
3. The problem → solution narrative
4. Professional quality with background music

## Script

### INTRO (Morgan - authoritative narrator)
```
Morgan: "What if you could turn any voice into unlimited speech?
Not just a few words. Not choppy segments.
But seamless, natural audio... of any length."
```

### THE PROBLEM (Rick - technical/cynical)
```
Rick: "Here's the problem, Morty. These AI voice models?
They can clone anyone's voice perfectly.
But they crap out after like fifty words.
Fifty words, Morty! That's nothing!"
```

### THE STRUGGLE (Morty - relatable frustration)
```
Morty: "Oh geez, Rick. So you're saying if I wanted to make
an audiobook or a podcast with my cloned voice,
it would just... stop working?"
```

### RICK CONFIRMS
```
Rick: "Exactly! You'd get choppy garbage.
Clicks between segments.
Words cutting off mid-sentence.
It's a nightmare, Morty."
```

### THE SOLUTION (Morgan - confident)
```
Morgan: "Open Unified TTS solves this.
It takes your text, splits it intelligently at natural pauses,
generates each piece within the model's limits,
then stitches everything together with seamless crossfades.
The result? This entire narration you're hearing right now...
generated from limited models, sounding completely natural."
```

### THE REVEAL (Rick - impressed despite himself)
```
Rick: "And get this - it works with any backend.
Local GPU models, cloud APIs, whatever.
One unified interface. OpenAI compatible.
Even Morty could set it up."
```

### CLOSING (Morty - enthusiastic)
```
Morty: "Wow Rick, that's actually really cool!
So anyone can have unlimited voice generation
with their own cloned voices?"
```

### FINAL TAG (Morgan)
```
Morgan: "Open Unified TTS.
Clone once. Generate forever.
Available now on GitHub."
```

## Production Notes

- Background music: Subtle tech/ambient, low volume
- Crossfades between speakers: 200ms
- Total runtime: ~75 seconds
- Voices: morgan, rick, morty (all via VoxCPM/loserbuddy-produce)
